    <h2>What You Need to Make Banana Pancakes</h2>

    <p>If you have ready-to-use bananas and a few kitchen staples, you already have everything you need to make perfect banana pancakes.</p>
    
    <h3>Banana Pancake Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Flour:</strong> All-purpose flour contains gluten, a protein that gives the pancakes structure and pleasant chewiness.</li>
        <li><strong>Sugar:</strong> Granulated sugar adds sweetness, helps hold in moisture, and may create a tender texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Baking Powder:</strong> Baking powder is a leavener. It creates air bubbles in the batter, which ensures light and fluffy pancakes.</li>
        <li><strong>Salt:</strong> Salt adds subtle depth to all sorts of sweet dishes, including pancakes. You won't be able to detect it in the finished product, but you'll miss it if you leave it out.</li>
        <li><strong>An Egg:</strong> Eggs work with the other ingredients to bind and provide structure. The fatty yolks also add rich flavor and extra moisture.</li>
        <li><strong>Milk:</strong> Not only does milk add flavor, it is the liquid base that's essential for dissolving the dry ingredients and creating a cohesive batter.</li>
        <li><strong>Vegetable Oil:</strong> Vegetable oil is harder to burn than butter, so it's a great fat to use in banana pancakes. It keeps the pancakes moist and prevents them from sticking to the pan.</li>
        <li><strong>Bananas:</strong> Last but <em>certainly</em> not least, you'll need two mashed bananas for these pancakes. The bananas will help hold the other ingredients together and add mellow, fruity flavor.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>How to Make Banana Pancakes</h4>

    <p>It really couldn't be easier to make this basic banana pancake recipe. You'll find the full recipe below, but here's a brief overview of what you can expect:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Mix:</strong> Combine your dry ingredients (flour, sugar, salt, baking powder) in one bowl and your wet ingredients (egg, milk, vegetable oil, mashed bananas) in another bowl. Add the dry ingredients to the bowl with the wet ingredients, then stir until they're incorporated. It's OK if your batter is slightly lumpy.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook:</strong> Pour the batter in ¼ cup portions onto a lightly oiled pan or griddle over medium-high heat. Cook for a few minutes, flip with a spatula, and cook for another few minutes (or until each side is golden brown).</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Serve your banana pancakes immediately. They're delicious alone or with your favorite pancake toppings.</li>
    </ol>

    <h5>HHow to Store Banana Pancakes</h5>

    <p>Don't throw away your extra pancakes! You can store them in an airtight container in the fridge for about two to three days. When you're ready to eat them, just reheat in the microwave until the pancakes are warmed through.</p>

    <h6>Can You Freeze Banana Pancakes?</h6>

    <p>Yes, you can freeze banana pancakes — and it's a great idea if you like to meal prep breakfasts. It couldn't be easier: Allow the pancakes to cool to room temperature, stack them in an airtight container with wax paper between each pancake (to prevent sticking), and freeze for about three months.<br>
    There's no need to thaw frozen pancakes. Simply reheat them in the toaster, microwave, or oven.</p>
